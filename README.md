# Google Apps as a *Route to Work*

Exploring Google Apps Certified Administrator for Job Seekers in Tower Hamlets.

## Why?

*Tower Hamlets* faces **two problems**<sup>1</sup>:

1. High Youth Unemployment (16-24 year olds) **15.4%**
2. Technical Skills Shortage.  

We propose making progress towards a potential solution to *both*.

<sup>1</sup><small>These are not *unique* to the borough,
most countries/cities face this exact pair of issues,
however we are focussing on solving them *locally* first.</small>

## *What*?

![job-center-people-waiting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10373918/3610fe5a-6de8-11e5-98f1-40b6da171bf9.jpg)

According to [*recent figures*, ***Youth Unemployment*** *remains* ***High*** *at* ***15.4%*** ](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/22/youth-unemployment-jobless-figure).
The statistics are *espcially grim* for [long-term unemployment for young ethnic minority people in
UK](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/10/50-rise-in-long-term-unemployed-youngsters-from-uk-ethnic-minorities); **up by 50%** since 2010.

While there are *several* government schemes to aid people in
getting in/back to work, few have proved successful.  

> *Often* people face a "*chicken and egg*" situation:
+ Can't get a job without experience ...
+ Can't get experience without a job ...  
> How can we *address* this?


### Google Apps?

![google apps for work logo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10389969/553b6d08-6e6d-11e5-921d-bb0bbc244e37.png)

The move to "The Cloud" has been *relentless* over the past 4 years.

Today over ***5 million businesses*** have switched to ***using Google Apps*** including:
FedEx, Ocado, The Guardian, National Geographic, The New York Times.
Most of the businesses using Google Apps are *Small and Medium* companies (***SME***s) and that's where the *opportunity* is.

![google-apps-overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10389573/b084b0e6-6e6a-11e5-9046-a49f62bd9365.png)

The features are industry leading, everything works immediately without
any setup costs and total cost of ownership is lower than other systems.

A Goolge Apps *Certificate* will help job-seekers ***stand out***
from the crowd.

## *How*?

We propose offering to ***guide*** job-seekers through the
e-learning course which will lead to Google Apps Certification.
We will coach each job-seeker through each of the 5 core apps:
Email, Calendar, Word Processing, Spreadsheets ("Google Docs") and Drive in a class-based learning environment till they reach *proficiency*.

### 2-4 hours per day for a 5-10 days *self-paced*

> It is ***possible*** to watch all the videos and complete the exercises in ***one day***. However we expect people to pace themselves and ask for help when they get stuck and get it done in a **week** or two.

### What *Qualifies* Founders & Coders to do *Google Apps* Training?

At [***Founders & Coders***](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/about/) we use ***Google Apps*** and have
*industry experience* of *introducing* companies to Google Apps/Docs,
we feel we can guide people through a *short* & *intensive*
program to equip people with the skills so they can *successfully* apply for jobs in businesses which are using Google Apps.

> *If* people on the Google Apps training decide they want to
*challenge* themselves to learn *development skills*
(*thus unlocking the most in-demand career opportunities*)
we can help coach them further after
they complete this initial training.

### e-Learning (*from anywhere, any device and at own pace*)

Because the course learning materials are online, anyone can
go through them on any device and at their own pace.
We will simply provide guidance and clarify any issues people face,
to keep them on track towards completing the certification.
