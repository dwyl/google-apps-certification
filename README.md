Exploring Google Apps Certified Administrator

## Why?

The *World* faces **two problems**:
1. high youth unemployment (16-24 year olds)
2. technical skills shortage.  

We propose making progress towards a potential solution to *both*.

## What?

According to [*recent figures*, ***Youth Unemployment*** *remains* ***High*** *at* ***15.4%*** ](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/22/youth-unemployment-jobless-figure).
The statistics are *espcially grim* for [long-term unemployment for young ethnic minority people in
UK](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/10/50-rise-in-long-term-unemployed-youngsters-from-uk-ethnic-minorities); **up by 50%** since 2010.

While there are *several* government schemes to aid people in
getting in/back to work, few have proved successful.  

> *Often* people face a "*chicken and egg*" situation:
+ Can't get a job without experience ...
+ Can't get experience without a job ...  
> How can we *address* this?

### Google Apps?

Over 5 million businesses have switched to using Google Apps including:
FedEx, Ocado, The Guardian, National Geographic, The New York Times.
Most of the businesses using Google Apps are *Small and Medium* companies (***SME***s) and that's where the *opportunity* is.

The features are industry leading, everything works immediately without
any setup costs and total cost of ownership is lower than other systems.
