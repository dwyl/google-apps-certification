Exploring Google Apps Certified Administrator

## Why?

The *World* faces **two problems**:
1. high youth unemployment (16-24 year olds)
2. technical skills shortage.  

We propose making progress towards a potential solution to *both*.

## *What*?

![job-center-people-waiting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10373918/3610fe5a-6de8-11e5-98f1-40b6da171bf9.jpg)

According to [*recent figures*, ***Youth Unemployment*** *remains* ***High*** *at* ***15.4%*** ](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/22/youth-unemployment-jobless-figure).
The statistics are *espcially grim* for [long-term unemployment for young ethnic minority people in
UK](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/10/50-rise-in-long-term-unemployed-youngsters-from-uk-ethnic-minorities); **up by 50%** since 2010.

While there are *several* government schemes to aid people in
getting in/back to work, few have proved successful.  

> *Often* people face a "*chicken and egg*" situation:
+ Can't get a job without experience ...
+ Can't get experience without a job ...  
> How can we *address* this?
